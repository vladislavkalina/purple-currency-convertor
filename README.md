# Getting Started with Purple Currency Convertor

Project consists from three components: backend and two alternatives of frontends.

## First steps after gitcloning

After you clone this repository, first step that you will have to do is installing node modules.

### `cd backend; npm install`

This will download and install Node modules for the backend component (about 3 MB).

### `cd client-React; npm install`

This command will download and install Node modules for the React-based frontend component (about 400 MB).

## Starting the project

All components can be started with a single command 

### `npm start`

This will start Node.JS with the backend component (listening on localhost port 3001) and also another Node.JS for the React-based frontend (listening on localhost port 3000), configured to proxy API requests to backend port 3001.

Backend port can be configred in `backend/config.json` if needed.

You will also need to register at https://openexchangerates.org and get your own API key. Once you have it, please put it to `backend/config.json`.

Alternatively you can start backend and React frontend separately with commands

`cd backend; npm start`
and
`cd client-React; npm start`

## Backend API for creating your own frontend

Backend component provides public API for creating your own frontend.

### `/api/convert`

This endpoint expect three input parameter passed in URL:
* amount - a float value representing the sum in the source currency to be converted
* src - code of the source currency; list of accepted codes can be obtained from API endpoint `/api/currencyCodes` (see below)
* dst - code of the destination currency

Example request:

`curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/api/convert?amount=1234&src=EUR&dst=CZK"`

Beside the amount in converted in the desired destination currency (`destinationAmount`) the response also contains `statistics` part containing values updated after the request. Example response:

>{
>    "destinationAmount": 30043.200960597893,
>    "statistics": {
>        "mostPopularCurrencies": "CZK",
>        "totalAmountConverted": 1277.3467623814133,
>        "numberOfRequestsMade": 1
>    }
>}

Method: **POST**

API may return error if input parameters are not passed correctly or the backend server has difficulties communicating to the external exchange rates provider. Statistics element may be empty when statistics are not read on the server. Than can happen shortly after backend start when the persistent storage is very slow.

### `/api/currencyCodes`

This endpoint doesn't expect any input parameter. Example request:

`curl http://localhost:3001/api/currencyCodes`

Example response:

>{
>    "currencyCodes": ["AED","AFN","ALL","AMD","ANG","AOA"]
>}

Method: **GET**

API may return error when the external exchange rates provider is not accessible for the backend server.

### `/api/statistics`

This endpoint doesn't expect any input parameter. Example request:

`curl localhost:3001/api/statistics`

Example response:

>{
>    "mostPopularCurrencies": "CZK",
>    "totalAmountConverted": 123456,
>    "numberOfRequestsMade": 1234
>}

Method: **GET**

API may return error when statistics are not ready on the server. It will happen especially shortly after start when the persistent storage is very slow.
